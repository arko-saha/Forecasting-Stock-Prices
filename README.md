# Forecasting Stock Market

This repository explores various techniques for stock market prediction, including:

* **Deep Learning:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks
* **Statistical Forecasting:** Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, and SARIMAX models

## Project Goals
This project aims to:

* Compare the performance of different prediction methods for stock prices.
* Gain insights into the effectiveness of machine learning and statistical approaches for financial forecasting.

## Getting Started
This project requires Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models), Plotly, and Facebook Prophet. Refer to the respective libraries' documentation for installation instructions.

## Data Acquisition:

The project relies on historical stock price data. You can obtain data from various sources like:
* YFinance: https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/
* Tiingo: https://www.tiingo.com/documentation/general/overview
